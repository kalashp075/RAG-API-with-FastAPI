# RAG-API-with-FastAPI
This project involved building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) API using FastAPI, Chroma, and Ollama with the tinyllama model. It taught me how to create an AI-powered question-answering system that uses a local knowledge base and provides interactive documentation via Swagger UI.
